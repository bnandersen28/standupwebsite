      <h1>Director</h1>
      <p>Corinne Garland has been a leader in the field of early childhood and early intervention in the public,
         private nonprofit, and university sectors.  Starting as a preschool director and kindergarten teacher,

        Corinne has been especially interested in ensuring access to quality services for young children 
        with disabilities and in ensuring that all our communityâ€™s children are welcomed and valued.  
        Her work with Stand Up for Yourself and Others! is an extension of that lifelong commitment 
        which has been recognized with awards including the International Division for Early Childhood 
        of Council award for Leadership to the Field, Daily Press Citizen of the Year, and Virginia
