    <p>     Stand up! For Yourself and Others is an anti-bullying initiative 
        sponsored by HART (Historic Area Religions Together, an organization 
        representing various faith communities in the Williamsburg Area. The 
        initiative was founded in October 2023. First activity was MLK Weekend, 
        a presentation of the puppet show, in response to the growing concern 
        of the effects of bullying on our children. </p>

        <p>Our mission is to help children learn to value individual differences and reduce the negative 
            effects of anti-group bias on children in our community. As part of this initiative we are providing 
            art and literature programs including books and puppet shows to local libraries and faith communities 
            that teach children the importance of valuing individuality.</p>
