            <p>Rabbi David Katz has been the rabbi of Temple Beth El of Williamsburg 
                since 2010. He grew up in New York City, and was ordained by the 
                Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 2009. In addition to serving 
                as the spiritual leader of Williamsburg’s only synagogue, he is one 
                of the founders and leaders of Historic Area Religions Together (HART), 
                the Historic Triangle’s multi faith organization of different religious 
                communities and leaders. He is a member of the Community Relations
                 Council of the United Jewish Communities of the Virginia Peninsula. 
                 He has also been a part of different working groups and committees 
                 for the Williamsburg/James City County School Division. In November 2020, 
                 the Greater Williamsburg Business Council named him one of the 15 Under 
                 50 up-and-coming business and civic leaders in Greater Williamsburg, 
                 in recognition of his impact on the community at large.
