          <p>Rabbi David Katz has been the rabbi of Temple Beth El of Williamsburg 
            since 2010. He grew up in New York City, and was ordained by the

            of the founders and leaders of Historic Area Religions Together (HART), 
            the Historic Triangle’s multi faith organization of different religious 
            communities and leaders. He is a member of the Community Relations Council 
            of the United Jewish Communities of the Virginia Peninsula. He has also 
            been a part of different working groups and committees for the Williamsburg/James
