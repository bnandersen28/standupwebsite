    <p>Join us for “Stand Up! For Yourself and Others” Story Hours at local libraries 
        and faith communities, where community leaders from all corners of Williamsburg 
        read stories to children that promote the value of individual differences. The 
        stories come from our carefully chosen book collection, which includes over 100 
        books we’ve donated to the Williamsburg Regional Library.</p>

            At “Stand Up! For yourself and others”, we are proud to partner up with the Rainbow Puppet Company, created by David Messick, whose anti-bullying puppet show program “Speak Out- The Search for Gold” has become a trusted resource for many schools and communities.  

            The program follows the Rainbow Puppeteers as they embark on a treasure hunt, teaching children that the greatest treasure is respect and trust for others. One of the key stories featured in the program, “The Wall,” highlights the importance of teamwork and valuing individual skills.
